# GoReleaser Action v4 Example: auto-snapshots

Auto-snapshots were removed from GoReleaser GitHub Action in v4.
This repo contains a way to re-enable it with some GitHub-Actions-fu.

You can see that GoReleaser automatically runs in snapshot mode 
[in PRs](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser-action-v4-auto-snapshot-example/pull/1),
and regularly in 
[tags](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser-action-v4-auto-snapshot-example/actions/runs/3819794958).
